# Install Duplicati as Windows Service

## Installation

Download Duplicati from [HERE](https://www.duplicati.com/download)

During install donâ€™t mark Auto Start up option

Open CMD as admin

Navigate to the installation folder in CMD (this should be the same as long as you left it as default)
```sh
cd "C:\Program Files\Duplicati 2\"
```

Now we will install the service 
`.\Duplicati.WindowsService.exe install`

Start the Duplicati service via Task Manager or Services.

Go to http://localhost:8200/ngax/index.html

You might have to reconfigure things since Duplicati is no longer running as your user and is running as a system user.
